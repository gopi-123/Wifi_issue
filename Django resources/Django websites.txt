I strongly suggest using virtualenv to install and manage Django installs. Jeff Knupp, and Michael Herman, both advise to use virtualenv, along with Daniel Greenfeld and Audrey Roy in their Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices For Django 1.11. The official tutorial can be a bit painful but you need to do it as it teaches critical fundamentals.
* VirtualEnv and Wrapper - Install and Usage guide, http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
All current editions of Python 3 come with venv, so there is no requirement to install a 3rd party package unless you want to, see Creation of virtual environments
