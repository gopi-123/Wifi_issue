**Day 3: Unit Testing, Mocking, and API Testing in Django**
- **Morning**:
  - Learn about unit testing in Django and how to write test cases for Django applications.
  - Understand the concepts of mocking and how to use it in unit tests to isolate dependencies.
- **Afternoon**:
  - Explore API testing in Django using tools like Django's test client or third-party libraries such as Requests.
  - Practice writing unit tests and API tests for Django views, models, and APIs.
- **Resources**:

  - [Unit Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)
  - [API Testing with Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/)

**Day 4: VS Code Setup for Python Code Formatting, Linting, and Code Coverage**
- **Morning**:
  - Configure VS Code for Python code formatting using tools like Black or autopep8.
  - Set up linting in VS Code to identify and fix code style issues using tools like pylint or flake8.
- **Afternoon**:
  - Learn about code coverage and how to measure code coverage in Python using tools like Coverage.py.
  - Configure VS Code to display code coverage information within the editor.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Code Formatting in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)
  - [Python Linting in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)

**Day 5: Poetry Setup and Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Morning**:
  - Learn about Poetry and how to use it as a dependency management tool for Python projects.
  - Set up Poetry for managing dependencies and virtual environments in your Django projects.
- **Afternoon**:
  - Explore continuous integration (CI) concepts and learn how to set up CI pipelines for Python projects using tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI.
  - Write YAML configurations for CI pipelines to automate testing, linting, and code formatting checks.
- **Resources**:
  - [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
  - [Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python)
  - [YAML Basics](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/advanced/yaml)

**Day 6: Django REST Framework**
- **Morning**:
  - Learn about Django REST Framework (DRF) and its features for building RESTful APIs in Django.
  - Understand the concepts of serializers, views, routers, and authentication in DRF.
- **Afternoon**:
  - Set up a simple Django project with DRF and create API endpoints for CRUD operations on a sample model.
  - Explore DRF's documentation and tutorials to learn about advanced features such as viewsets, pagination, and authentication classes.
- **Resources**:
  - [Django REST Framework Documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
  - [DRF Tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)

**Day 7: Project Integration and Review**
- **Morning**:
  - Integrate the concepts and tools you've learned throughout the week into a sample Django project.
  - Implement unit tests, API endpoints, code formatting, linting, and CI/CD pipelines in your project.
- **Afternoon**:
  - Review your project code, documentation, and CI/CD setup to ensure everything is working correctly and meets your quality standards.
  - Make any necessary improvements or refinements based on feedback or best practices.
- **Resources**:
  - Your own project implementation and documentation.
  - Peer review or feedback from mentors or colleagues.

Throughout the week, make sure to allocate time for hands-on practice, experimentation, and troubleshooting. Don't hesitate to refer back to documentation, tutorials, or online resources as needed. Additionally, consider joining developer communities or forums where you can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from others in the field. Good luck with your learning journey!
