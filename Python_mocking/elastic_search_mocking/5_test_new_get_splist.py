#I see, my apologies for misunderstanding your question. Let's adjust the mock Elasticsearch response to include the `released` field with the appropriate value. Here's the corrected version of the unit test:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from new_get_splist import get_sp_list_with_release_date

class TestGetSpListWithReleaseDate(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('new_get_splist.Elasticsearch')
    def test_get_sp_list_with_release_date(self, mock_elasticsearch):
        # Mock Elasticsearch client and search result
        mock_search_result = {
            "hits": {
                "hits": [
                    {"_source": {"released_flag": True, "released_converted": "wk2412.4", "released": "2024-03-21"}, "_id": "1"}
                ]
            }
        }
        mock_es_instance = mock_elasticsearch.return_value
        mock_es_instance.search.return_value = mock_search_result

        # Call the function under test
        sp_name = 'SP33'
        index_service_packs = 'fco-on-demand-service-packs'
        release_id = '7.4.0.b'
        machine_type = 'World-Wide'
        result = get_sp_list_with_release_date(sp_name, index_service_packs, release_id, machine_type)

        # Assert the results
        expected_result = [
            {'SP33': {'released': True, 'release_date': 'wk2412.4 (2024-03-21)'}}
        ]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

In this corrected version:
- We include the `released` field in the Elasticsearch response with the appropriate value.
- The `released_converted` field is set to "wk2412.4" and the `released` field is set to "2024-03-21" in the mock response.
- We adjust the expected result to match the updated release date information.

Now the unit test should pass with the corrected mock Elasticsearch response. Let me know if you need further assistance!
