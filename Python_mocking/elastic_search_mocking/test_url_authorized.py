# Example of authroized and unauthorized access

To test both authorized and unauthorized access using Django's test client, you can simulate requests with different authentication states. Here's how you can modify the previous test case to include tests for both authorized and unauthorized access:

```python
from django.test import TestCase, Client
from django.urls import reverse

class UrlAccessTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a test client
        self.client = Client()

    def test_fpas_query_v2_reverse(self):
        # Define the expected URL parameters
        release_id = '123'
        machine_type = 'xyz'

        # Reverse the URL using the name
        url = reverse('fpas_query_v2', args=[release_id, machine_type])

        # Define the expected reversed URL
        expected_url = f'/api/v2/fpas/{release_id}/{machine_type}/'

        # Assert that the reversed URL matches the expected URL
        self.assertEqual(url, expected_url)

    def test_unauthorized_access(self):
        # Make a GET request to the URL without authentication
        response = self.client.get(reverse('fpas_query_v2', args=['123', 'xyz']))

        # Assert that the response status code is 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)

    def test_authorized_access(self):
        # Simulate authenticated access by logging in a user
        self.client.login(username='test_user', password='test_password')

        # Make a GET request to the URL with authentication
        response = self.client.get(reverse('fpas_query_v2', args=['123', 'xyz']))

        # Assert that the response status code is 200 OK for authorized access
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

In this modified test case:

- We've added a `setUp` method to create a test client (`self.client`) before each test method is executed.
- We've added two new test methods: `test_unauthorized_access` and `test_authorized_access`.
- In `test_unauthorized_access`, we make a GET request to the URL without any authentication. We expect this request to return a status code of 403 (Forbidden).
- In `test_authorized_access`, we simulate authenticated access by logging in a user using `self.client.login`. Then we make a GET request to the URL. We expect this request to return a status code of 200 (OK) since the user is authenticated.

You can run these test methods along with other tests in your Django project to verify both authorized and unauthorized access to the URL. Make sure to replace `'test_user'` and `'test_password'` with actual credentials if you're using Django's authentication system.

### Example of Authorized access
Yes, you can mock the authentication process to return a 200 status code for authorized access without actually using tokens or involving the authentication mechanism. This approach is often used in unit tests to isolate the behavior being tested from external dependencies like authentication mechanisms.

You can achieve this by mocking the behavior of your view function or class-based view to bypass the authentication checks. Here's an example using the `unittest.mock` module in Python:

########## 

from django.test import TestCase, Client
from django.urls import reverse
from unittest.mock import patch

class UrlAccessTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a test client
        self.client = Client()

    @patch('your_app.views.fpas_query_v2')  # Replace 'your_app' with the actual name of your Django app
    def test_authorized_access(self, mock_fpas_query_v2):
        # Mock the return value of the view function to simulate authorized access
        mock_fpas_query_v2.return_value = HttpResponse(status=200)

        # Make a GET request to the URL
        response = self.client.get(reverse('fpas_query_v2', args=['123', 'xyz']))

        # Assert that the response status code is 200 OK
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

##############

In this example:

- We use the `@patch` decorator from `unittest.mock` to patch the `fpas_query_v2` view function. Replace `'your_app.views.fpas_query_v2'` with the actual path to your view function.
- Inside the test method, `mock_fpas_query_v2` is passed as an argument, representing the mocked view function.
- We mock the return value of the view function to return an `HttpResponse` with a status code of 200.
- When the test makes a GET request to the URL, it calls the patched version of `fpas_query_v2`, which returns the mocked response with a 200 status code.
- Finally, we assert that the response status code is 200.

This approach allows you to isolate the behavior of your view function from the authentication mechanism, effectively testing the behavior of the view without relying on actual authentication tokens or mechanisms.
